The status of my project is that I am fully caught up to the end of phase 1 except that my video still won't display. I have a pixel generator and a VTC that operate as expected (as seen through the test benches). My signal tap shows similar results to the test benches, but I want to spend more time with different triggers and data captures to ensure that the board is following along with the test bench itself. Overall, it would be going good, except that it doesn't work.
